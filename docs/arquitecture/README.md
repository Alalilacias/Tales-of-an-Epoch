# Architecture Documentation

The **architecture** folder provides detailed documentation on the system design and structure of **Tales of an Epoch**. This documentation outlines the core architecture of the backend microservices, including data flow, communication protocols, and how each component interacts. It serves as a technical guide for developers to understand, maintain, and expand the system.

## Purpose

The architecture documentation helps maintain clarity on how the system is organized and supports efficient development and debugging. It includes breakdowns of each microservice's responsibilities, interactions, and dependencies. This resource is especially useful for new developers joining the project and for ensuring consistency in development practices.

## Structure

The folder includes the following files:

- **overview.md**: Provides a high-level overview of the system's architecture, including an architectural diagram and descriptions of each main component.
- **microservices.md**: Describes each microservice's function, key features, and responsibilities in detail.
- **data-flow.md**: Documents the flow of data across services, outlining dependencies, data transformations, and storage.
- **communication.md**: Explains the communication protocols and patterns used between services, including REST APIs, message brokers, and WebSocket connections for real-time interactions.

These documents collectively provide a thorough reference for understanding the backend structure, making it easier to build, test, and scale the system as needed.
