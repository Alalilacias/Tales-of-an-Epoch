To incorporate a **Godot Project folder** for building the client, here’s an updated documentation and folder structure that keeps backend and client documentation organized within the main project. This modification will accommodate both the backend services and the Godot-based client, making it easy to manage and access documentation for both parts.

### **Updated Documentation Structure with Godot Client Folder**

1. **Root-Level Documents**: Essential high-level docs for general understanding and initial setup.
   - **`README.md`**: The main document users see when they open the repository. It gives an overview, setup instructions, and a brief intro to each microservice and the client.
   - **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**: Contains contributing guidelines, including code standards, branching/naming conventions, and instructions for submitting pull requests.
   - **`LICENSE`** (optional): Specifies the licensing terms for your project.

2. **`docs/` Directory**: Contains more detailed and technical documentation for both backend and client.
   - **`docs/architecture/`**: Detailed architectural information for the backend microservices.
      - **`docs/architecture/overview.md`**: High-level overview of the backend system’s architecture, including diagrams and descriptions of how microservices fit into the overall system.
      - **`docs/architecture/microservices.md`**: Breakdown of each microservice, its responsibilities, and interactions with other services.
      - **`docs/architecture/data-flow.md`**: Details on data flow and dependencies between microservices, with flowcharts or diagrams if needed.
      - **`docs/architecture/communication.md`**: Explanation of communication protocols (REST, message queues, WebSockets) and their purpose.
   - **`docs/api/`**: API documentation for backend microservices.
      - **`docs/api/user_service.md`**: API documentation for the User Service, with additional files for each microservice as needed.
   - **`docs/environment/`**: Setup and deployment guides for backend services.
      - **`docs/environment/configuration.md`**: Explanation of environment variables and configurations for running the backend.
      - **`docs/environment/deployment.md`**: Deployment instructions for different environments (local, staging, production).

3. **`microservices/` Directory**: Each microservice has its own folder, containing:
   - **`README.md`**: Explains the microservice's functionality, setup, and dependencies.
   - **`api-spec/`**: Contains API specs (e.g., Swagger files) if needed for complex interactions.

4. **`client/` Directory**: Contains the Godot project files and client-specific documentation.
   - **`client/godot_project/`**: The folder housing the main Godot project files, such as scenes, scripts, and assets.
   - **`client/README.md`**: Provides setup and configuration instructions for the Godot project, including any dependencies and setup needed to start the client.
   - **`docs/client/architecture/`**: Detailed architectural information for the client.
      - **`docs/client/architecture/overview.md`**: Overview of the client-side architecture, including design patterns and modular components within Godot.
      - **`docs/client/architecture/communication.md`**: Explanation of how the client communicates with the backend, including WebSocket usage and API calls.

5. **`cheatsheets/` Directory**: Quick reference materials and best practices.
   - **`cheatsheets/commit_cheatsheet.md`**: Guidelines and examples for Conventional Commits.
   - **`cheatsheets/build_cheatsheet.md`**: Quick build and deployment instructions for both backend and client environments.

### Summary

This structure organizes documentation for both backend services and the Godot client under a unified structure, making it straightforward for contributors to find relevant information. The **`client/`** folder is set up to contain the Godot project files and any client-specific documentation, while the **`docs/client/`** subdirectory provides in-depth architectural documentation for the client. This structure also keeps backend and client documentation organized, supporting clear development practices on both sides of the project.
