# Microservice Prototype Structure

The following is the response given by ChatGPT to the following prompts (more than one were necessary):

    - How would you design the backend of a multiplayer game, using Godot as it's engine.
    - Let's organize it as a microservice.

A few modifications were made to the final document, but the basis is there.

If you want to use microservices for a game like *Tales of an Epoch*, it makes sense to separate core functionalities into distinct services that can scale independently. Each service would focus on a specific domain of the game (e.g., player management, resource handling, combat system, chat, etc.) and communicate with each other through APIs or message brokers. You could also use different technologies for different services, depending on their needs and performance requirements.

Here’s a breakdown of how I’d organize the game into microservices, suggestions for technologies, and how they can connect to *Godot*.

### **1. Microservice Architecture Overview**
The goal of microservices is to break down the game into smaller, isolated services that handle different parts of the game logic and can scale or be updated independently.

#### **Microservices Separation**
Here’s a high-level separation of the game into microservices:

- **Authentication & Player Management**: Handles user registration, authentication, and player profiles.
- **Resource Management**: Manages player resources (gold, wood, etc.) and production systems.
- **Combat System**: Manages battles between players, including combat logic, units, and outcomes.
- **World Map & Exploration**: Manages map-related actions, exploration, territories, and alliances.
- **Alliance System**: Handles alliances, team interactions, and social features.
- **Inventory & Items**: Manages player inventories, items, and crafting systems.
- **Real-Time Multiplayer**: Handles WebSocket connections for real-time gameplay, messaging, and interactions.
- **Notifications**: Manages in-game notifications, reminders, and system alerts for players.

Each service has its own database and can be deployed independently. They communicate through REST APIs, gRPC, or a message broker like RabbitMQ or Kafka for real-time communication.

### **2. Microservice Breakdown & Technologies**

1. **Authentication & Player Management Service**
    - **Responsibilities**: User registration, login/logout, JWT authentication, player profiles, player progression.
    - **Technologies**:
        - **Language**: Java with Spring Boot or Node.js with Express.js.
        - **Database**: MongoDB for player profiles and NoSQL-style player progression storage.
    - **Endpoints**:
        - `POST /auth/register`: Register a new player.
        - `POST /auth/login`: Authenticate a player and issue a JWT token.
        - `GET /players/{id}`: Fetch player profile.
    - **Scalability**: Can scale horizontally since it's stateless and uses JWT for authentication.

2. **Resource Management Service**
    - **Responsibilities**: Tracks and updates in-game resources (e.g., wood, gold, mana), production systems, and resource decay.
    - **Technologies**:
        - **Language**: Python with Flask or Node.js for its simplicity in handling small data updates.
        - **Database**: Redis for real-time resource updates and caching, MongoDB for persistent storage of resources.
    - **Endpoints**:
        - `POST /resources/update`: Update player resources.
        - `GET /resources/{playerId}`: Get player’s resource state.
    - **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ or Kafka can be used to handle resource updates (e.g., production every minute).

3. **Combat System Service**
    - **Responsibilities**: Handles combat calculations, battle outcomes, damage models, and unit management.
    - **Technologies**:
        - **Language**: Java with Spring Boot or GoLang for high-performance, low-latency calculations.
        - **Database**: MongoDB for storing unit data, battle outcomes, and historical combat data.
    - **Endpoints**:
        - `POST /combat/engage`: Initiate a battle between two players.
        - `GET /combat/results/{battleId}`: Fetch the result of a battle.
    - **Message Queue**: Events like `battle_start` or `battle_end` could trigger other game systems via a message queue.

4. **World Map & Exploration Service**
    - **Responsibilities**: Manages world state, exploration, territory control, and player movement on the world map.
    - **Technologies**:
        - **Language**: Node.js with Express or Python with FastAPI for easy handling of player movements.
        - **Database**: MongoDB for storing the world state (which players control which territories).
    - **Endpoints**:
        - `GET /world/map`: Get the current state of the world map.
        - `POST /world/explore`: Send a player to explore a new territory.
        - `POST /world/claim`: Claim a new territory for a player.
    - **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket can be used for real-time updates on territory changes and exploration.

5. **Alliance & Social System Service**
    - **Responsibilities**: Manages player alliances, invites, team interactions, and social features.
    - **Technologies**:
        - **Language**: Ruby on Rails or Java Spring Boot for fast CRUD operations.
        - **Database**: MongoDB for storing alliances and social data.
    - **Endpoints**:
        - `POST /alliances/create`: Create a new alliance.
        - `POST /alliances/invite`: Invite a player to join an alliance.
        - `GET /alliances/{id}`: Get details of an alliance.

6. **Real-Time Multiplayer Service (WebSocket)**
    - **Responsibilities**: Manages WebSocket connections for real-time multiplayer gameplay, messaging, and real-time interactions like battles.
    - **Technologies**:
        - **Language**: Node.js with Socket.IO or Java with Spring WebSocket.
        - **Message Broker**: Redis Pub/Sub for real-time message exchange between players.
        - **Endpoints**:
            - WebSocket-based connection for real-time updates on battles, alliances, etc.
    - **Scalability**: Use Redis to scale horizontally across WebSocket connections.

7. **Notifications Service**
    - **Responsibilities**: Sends in-game notifications to players (battle reports, reminders, or alliance messages).
    - **Technologies**:
        - **Language**: Python or Node.js with a lightweight framework like Flask or FastAPI.
        - **Queue**: RabbitMQ or Kafka to queue notifications and ensure delivery.
        - **Database**: MongoDB for storing notification history.
    - **Endpoints**:
        - `POST /notifications/send`: Send a notification to a player.

### **3. Communication Between Microservices**
Communication between microservices can be done through REST APIs, gRPC (if you need high-performance RPC calls), or a message broker like **RabbitMQ** or **Apache Kafka** to handle event-driven architecture. For example, the **Resource Management Service** can trigger a message to the **Combat Service** when a player gains enough resources to upgrade their units.

### **4. Connecting Microservices to Godot**
Godot is highly capable of integrating with microservice backends. Here’s how you can connect it:

- **REST APIs**: Godot has native support for making HTTP requests using the `HTTPRequest` node or the `HTTPClient` class. You can use this to interact with the backend services via REST endpoints. For example:
  ```gdscript
  var http_request = HTTPRequest.new()
  var url = "http://localhost:8080/api/resources/update"
  var body = {"playerId": "123", "resourceType": "gold", "amount": 100}
  http_request.request(url, [], true, HTTPClient.METHOD_POST, JSON.print(body))
  ```

- **WebSocket Connections**: Godot also has WebSocket support, which allows real-time communication with the **Real-Time Multiplayer Service**. This can be used for chat, real-time updates during battles, or alliance activities.
  ```gdscript
  var websocket = WebSocketClient.new()
  websocket.connect_to_url("ws://localhost:3000/realtime", [], true)
  ```

- **Message Queues**: If you need to process real-time updates and notifications, you can use message queues in the backend to communicate state changes to the client in an efficient way. Godot won’t directly connect to message brokers like RabbitMQ but will receive updates via the WebSocket service or a REST-based notification endpoint.

### **5. Advantages of Using Microservices**
- **Scalability**: Services can be scaled independently. For example, if combat calculations become heavy, you can scale the **Combat Service** without affecting other services.
- **Flexibility in Technology**: Each microservice can be built with the best technology for the job. For instance, you could use **GoLang** for combat calculations for performance, and **Node.js** for real-time WebSocket handling.
- **Decoupled Development**: Different teams can work on different services without affecting each other.
- **Fault Isolation**: If one service fails, the rest of the system can continue to function.

### **6. Challenges with Microservices**
- **Increased Complexity**: Managing multiple services adds complexity, especially in deployment and testing.
- **Latency**: Inter-service communication can introduce latency, especially in real-time systems, but this can be mitigated with a well-designed message broker.
- **Data Consistency**: Maintaining data consistency across services (especially with NoSQL databases) can be challenging and might require techniques like event sourcing or eventual consistency.

### **Conclusion**
Using microservices for an online game like *Tales of an Epoch* provides immense flexibility, scalability, and robustness. You can break the game down into isolated, domain-driven services that can evolve independently. You can use different technologies for different services, optimizing each for its task (e.g., Python for simple tasks, Go for performance-critical tasks). Godot can easily interact with the backend through REST APIs and WebSockets, ensuring smooth client-server communication for the game.
