# API Documentation

The **API** folder contains detailed documentation for each microservice's API in **Tales of an Epoch**. These documents provide easy access to information about each service's endpoints, request parameters, and responses directly from the repository. This allows developers and contributors to understand and integrate with the APIs without needing to start the entire project or rely on Swagger documentation alone.

## Purpose

Each microservice in Tales of an Epoch has specific functionality, and this folder organizes API documentation by service. The documentation in this folder complements our Swagger API specifications, allowing quick reference to each serviceâ€™s details without deploying the services. Swagger is also available for live API interaction when the project is running, enabling further exploration and testing of each endpoint.

## Structure

The folder includes individual `.md` files for each service's API, such as:

- **user_service.md**: Manages user registration, authentication, and player profiles.
- **resource_service.md**: Handles resource management for players.
- **combat_service.md**: Controls endpoints for battles and combat outcomes.

Each file describes endpoints, methods, example requests, and responses specific to that service.

Refer to these documents for efficient API development and integration.
