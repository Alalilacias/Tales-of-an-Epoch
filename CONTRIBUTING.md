# CONTRIBUTING.md

Handling branching in Git for a large project, especially in the context of a game with both backend and frontend components, is crucial for maintaining organization and collaboration. Hereâ€™s our branching and workflow strategy. Please follow these guidelines.

### 1. **Branching Strategy**
- **Main Branch (`main`)**: Contains stable, production-ready code and reflects completed, tested features and bug fixes. Only authorized contributors should merge into this branch.
- **Development Branch (`develop`)**: Serves as the integration branch for ongoing development. Completed features should be merged here for testing before being moved to `main`.
- **Feature Branches**: For each new feature or piece of functionality, create a separate branch from `develop`. Use a naming convention like `feature/feature-name`.
- **Bugfix Branches**: Similar to feature branches, but for bug fixes. Use a naming convention like `bugfix/bug-description`.
- **Hotfix Branches**: For urgent fixes needed directly in `main`. Name them like `hotfix/fix-description`.

### 2. **Workflow Example**

1. **Pull the Latest Develop Branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   ```

2. **Create a Feature Branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/login-system
   ```

3. **Implement Your Feature**: Make changes, then commit them with clear, descriptive messages.
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat(login): implement user login system"
   ```

4. **Merge Feature into Develop**:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git merge feature/login-system
   ```

5. **Test in Develop**: Ensure everything works as expected in the `develop` branch.

### 3. **Commit Strategy**

To keep commit history clean and meaningful, we follow a **Commit Strategy** using clear, conventional commit messages that describe the purpose of each change. This helps maintainers and other developers understand what each change accomplishes at a glance.

- **Conventional Commits**: Use a structured message format to indicate the type, scope, and purpose of each commit. Example format:
  ```
  <type>(<scope>): <subject>
  ```
   - **type**: Describes the kind of change (e.g., `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, etc.).
   - **scope**: Briefly describes the area of the code affected (e.g., `login`, `database`, `UI`).
   - **subject**: A concise description of the change.

- **Examples**:
  ```bash
  git commit -m "feat(auth): add JWT authentication"
  git commit -m "fix(profile): correct avatar upload bug"
  ```

- **Common Commit Types**:
   - `feat`: A new feature
   - `fix`: A bug fix
   - `docs`: Documentation-only changes
   - `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
   - `test`: Adding or updating tests
   - `style`: Code style changes (e.g., formatting, indentation)

### 4. **Pull Requests (PR)**

- **Creating a PR**: Once you push your feature branch to GitHub, create a PR to `develop`. This allows code reviews, testing, and discussion.
- **Merging PRs**: Once approved, merge the PR into `develop`. Major releases to `main` should be done with a PR from `develop` to `main` by senior contributors.

### 5. **Branch Cleanup**

After merging a feature or bugfix branch, delete it to keep the branch list clean:
```bash
git branch -d feature/login-system
```

### 6. **Regular Merges and Updates**

- Regularly merge `develop` into your feature branches to stay updated with recent changes and minimize conflicts.
- Consider **rebasing** on `develop` to keep your branch history clean, but consult with senior contributors if needed.
